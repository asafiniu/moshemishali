v[:synopsis] ='Rachel is a librarian; she knows all about how language works. When her lover\'s mobile phone rings twice during a sleep over in her flat, he informs her of its meaning. His wife needs him, it is urgent and overrides their arrangement that he keep a mistress. At 70, how will Rachel find a love deeper than Motti\'s and move from mistress to top billing? She must act. With the help of a younger colleague, she \"tweaks\" her internet profile and begins the dispiriting process of dating. Disappointment is everywhere, just as it is for younger wannabe lovers. It\'s not so much a moral dilemma as a literary one.<br><br><b>CFC - Toronto International Film Festival</b> - 2011<br><b>MIFF - Milano International Film Festival</b> - 2011<br><b>L.A.
